## Features

### Signup
 `POST`: `auth/signup` See [controller](https://github.com/jimousse/node-rest-api/blob/main/controllers/auth/signup.js).

Create a new user with a password and an email
- The client sends the following request:
```
{
   "method":"PUT",
   "headers":{
      "Content-Type":"application/json"
   },
   "body":"{"email": "jimmy@email.com", "password":"password"}"
}
```
- the server checks whether the email exists in the database
- if not, it hashes the password and then insert the user into the database

### Login
 `POST`: `auth/login` See [controller](https://github.com/jimousse/node-rest-api/blob/main/controllers/auth/login.js).

Logs in a returning user.
- The client sends the following request:
```
{
   "method":"POST",
   "headers":{
      "Content-Type":"application/json"
   },
   "body":"{"email": "jimmy@email.com", "password":"password"}"
}
```
- the server checks whether the email exists in the database
- if so, it hashes the password received and compares it with the one stored in the database for that user
- if match, the server generates a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) token that contains the user id to the client

### Create/modify a post
 `POST`: `feed/post` See [controller](https://github.com/jimousse/node-rest-api/blob/main/controllers/feed/create-post.js).

`PUT`: `feed/post` (for modify)

Creates/modifies a social media post for a logged in user and stores it in the user entry.
- The client sends the following request:
```
{
   "method":"POST",
   "headers":{
      "Authorization: "Bearer <user-jwt-token>"
   },
   "body":"{"title": "My title", "content":"The content of my post", image: <image-file.png>}"
}
```
- the server decodes the token in the header and checks that it is valid and retrieves the user id from it and checks that it's valid
- it stores the image received on the server (if there is an image already, it replaces it)
- it creates a new post/modidies the post in the database with the `title`, `content`, `imageUrl` (path of the file on the server) and `creator` (ref to a user id)

   }
}
```
- the server decodes the token in the header and checks that it is valid and retrieves the user id from it and checks that it's valid
- gets the post from the database and sends it back to the client
